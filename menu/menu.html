						<h3>Game Instructions</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> The game consists of four participants, each representing a color and with four pins.  </li>
							<li> Each player's goal is to take a turn, with each of its four pins, on the board. The one who finishes it first wins.  </li>
							<li> In order to get out of the starting position, the player must take on the die in his turn the number 1 or 6 and thus can move the respective pin.  </li>
							<li> If the movement of a pin by a player results in a house with a pin of the same color, there is duplication of pins, making it easier to move.  </li>
							<li> Upon reaching the last house of the carpet of the respective color, after completing the turn, the pin is automatically calculated as completed.  </li>
							<li> The first player to get all four tokens into the center will win the game. </li>
