This project explores the development and implementation of Ludo games using WebGL (Web Graphics Library) technology. 
Ludo, a popular board game enjoyed by people of all ages, has undergone a transformation with the advent of WebGL, enabling the creation of immersive and visually appealing digital versions. This project investigates the process of leveraging WebGL to enhance the gameplay experience, bringing the traditional board game to life in a web browser environment. The project examines the technical aspects of WebGL-based Ludo games, their visual and interactive features, and the impact of this technology on player engagement and enjoyment. The findings contribute to the understanding of WebGL's capabilities in creating compelling digital adaptations of classic board games and provide insights into the potential of WebGL as a platform for future game development.

Realistic graphics: WebGL allows developers to create
realistic 3D graphics that can make Ludo games more
immersive and engaging.

Smooth gameplay: WebGL games can be rendered
smoothly even on low-end devices, making them
accessible to a wider range of players.

Cross-platform compatibility: WebGL games can be
played on any device that has a web browser, making
them truly global.

It is mainly a classic game of strategy, luck, and com-
petition, which can be played by two to four players. The
objective of Ludo is to move all your tokens from the starting
point to the center of the board, known as the home before
your opponents do. To play Ludo, players take turns rolling
a dice and moving their tokens accordingly. The number
rolled on the dice determines how many squares a player’s
token can advance. Players must strategically navigate their
tokens around the board, avoiding obstacles and capturing
opponents’ tokens when they land on the same square. The
game incorporates elements of strategy, as players can choose
to focus on advancing their own tokens or hindering their
opponents’ progress
